    <h2><u>Method Overriding</u></h2>
    
   If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java <br>
   If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding <br>
   Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism
   
   <h2><u>Rules for Method Overriding</u></h2>
   <ul>
       <li>The method must have the same name as in the parent class
       <li>The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class</li>
       <li>There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance)</li>
   </ul>
